You can control the Vim clients and get notifications about what they are doing.\n\nThe protocol is named NetBeans for historical reasons, and does not actually require the NetBeans IDE or Java.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    npm install vim-netbeans\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n```js\nvar nb = require(\"vim-netbeans\");\nvar server = new nb.VimServer();\nserver.on(\"clientAuthed\", function (vim) {\n\tvim.on(\"insert\", function (buffer, offset, text) {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Inserted text at \" + offset + \": \" + text);\n\t});\n\n\tvim.on(\"remove\", function (buffer, offset, length) {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Removed \" + length + \" bytes at \" + offset);\n\t});\n});\nserver.listen();\n```\n\nSee `example.js` for a larger example.\n\nConnecting\n----------\n\nTo connect to your NetBeans server, launch Vim with `-nb` or use the command `:nbs` in Vim.  To close the connection, Use `:nbc`.\n\nHost, port, and password can be specified with `:nbs:{hostname}:{port}:{password}`\n\nConnection information can also be read from a file or environment. See the [Vim Documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/netbeans.html#netbeans-run).\n\nAPI Documentation\n=================\n\nThis API is an abstraction over the [Vim Netbeans Protocol](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/netbeans.html), a socket interface intended for Vim integration into an IDE.\n\nVimServer\n---------\n\nA server that listens for connections from Vim.\n\n### VimServer Constants\n\n* **defaultPort** (`3219`) default Vim netbeans socket port\n* **defaultPassword** (`\"changeme\"`) default password that Vim connects with\n\n### VimServer Properties\n\n* **server** (`net.Server`) underlying socket server\n* **clients** (`array<VimClient>`) Vim clients connected to this server\n* **httpServer** (`http.Server`) optional HTTP server for multiplexing\n\n### VimServer Functions\n\n* **new VimServer**([options]) - Create and configure a new Vim NetBeans server, with properties as follows:\n    * **debug** - (`boolean`: defaults to false) If true, socket communication will be printed.\n\n* **listen**([port], [host], [backlog], [callback]) - Bind the server to a port.\n    * **port** - (`number|string`: defaults to *defaultPort*) the port number to bind to connections\n    * **backlog** - (`number|string`) maximum length of the queue of pending\n    * **host** - (`string`: defaults to any IPv4) the hostname to bind to\n    * **callback** - (`function`) called when the port is bound to the server\n\n  See also [net.Server.listen(port)](http://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_port_host_backlog_callback).\n\n* **handleHTTP**(server) - Multiplex HTTP on the same port as the NetBeans server.\n    * **server** - (`http.Server`) the HTTP server to pass requests to\n\n### VimServer Events\n\n* **clientAuthed**(client, password) - A Vim client successfully connected and sent an AUTH event\n    * **client** - (`VimClient`) the client that connected\n    * **password** - (`string`) the password the client supplied\n\nVimClient\n---------\n\nRepresents a Vim program that has connected to a VimServer.\n\n### VimClient properties\n\n* **socket** (`net.Socket`) underlying socket connection\n\n* **server** (`VimServer`) the server managing this client connection\n\n* **buffers** (`array<VimBuffer|null>`) buffers we are controlling. Indexed by `buffer.id`, starting at 1. Buffers that were removed have `null` in their places.\n\n### VimClient Functions\n\n* **disconnect**() - Break the connection and quit Vim. Only send when there are no unsaved changes. See also `saveAndExit`.\n\n* **detach**() - Break the connection without exiting the editor.\n\n* **key**(key, listener) - Register a function to be called when the vim user presses a certain key. Once set, a key listener cannot be removed, but you can change the listener function by calling `key(key, ...)` again.\n    * **key** - (`string`) Key name. Supported are:\n        * `'F1'`, `'F2'`, â€¦, `'F12'` function keys\n        * `' '` space\n        * any ASCII printable character\n        * `'X'` any unrecognized key\n\n        The key may be prepended by `C`, `S` and/or `M`, with a hyphen,  for Control, Shift and Meta (Alt) modifiers. e.g.:\n        * `'C-F2'` control-F2\n\n    * **listener** - (`function(buffer, offset, lnum, col)`) called when the user presses the key. If `listener` is not a function, the events for the given key are ignored.\n        * **buffer** - (`VimBuffer`) the buffer in which the key was pressed\n        * **offset** - (`number`) byte offset of the cursor in the buffer\n        * **lnum** - (`number`) line number of the cursor\n        * **col** - (`number`) column number of the cursor\n\n* **createBuffer**():buffer - Create and return an unnamed buffer, and make it the current buffer for the client.\n    * **buffer** - (`VimBuffer`) the buffer created\n\n* **editFile**(pathname, callback) - Open a file for editing.\n    * **pathname** - (`string`) the file to edit\n    * **callback** - (`function(buffer)`) called when the file has been opened\n        * **buffer** - (`VimBuffer`) the newly created buffer\n\n* **raise**() - Bring the editor to the foreground. *Requires Vim with GUI.*\n\n* **showBalloon**(text) - Display a balloon/tooltip at the mouse position, containing some text. It disappears when the mouse moves away. *Requires Vim with GUI.*\n    * **text** - (`string`) text to show in the balloon\n\n* **getCursor**(callback) - Get the current buffer and cursor position.\n    * **callback** - (`function(buffer, lnum, col, offset)`)\n        * **buffer** - (`VimBuffer|null`) the current buffer, or null if it is a mystery\n        * **lnum** - (`number`) - line number of the cursor (first line is one)\n        * **col** - (`number`) - column number of the cursor (in bytes, zero based)\n        * **offset** - (`number`) offset of the cursor in the buffer (in bytes)\n\n* **getModified**(callback) - Get the number of buffers with changes\n    * **callback** - (`function(num)`)\n        * **num** - (`number`) number of buffers with changes\n\n* **saveAndExit**(callback) - Ask the client to save all buffers and exit (`:confirm qall`). If the user cancels this operation, the number of modified buffers is returned.\n    * **callback** - (`function(result)`)\n        * **result** - (`number|null`) number of modified buffers, or null if the client exited and closed the connection.\n\n### VimClient Events\n\n* **newBuffer**(buffer) - The client has opened a new buffer and we are claiming it. Also fired if the user presses a special key in a buffer weNot fired if the server creates the buffer with `createBuffer` or `editFile`.\n    * **buffer** - (`VimBuffer`) the new buffer\n\n* **disconnect**() - Vim is exiting.\n\n* **disconnected**() - The connection with the client has closed. After this event, all listeners for the client and its buffers will be removed.\n\n* **fileOpened**(pathname) - A file was opened by the user.\n    * **pathname** - (`string`) name of the file\n\n* **startupDone**() - The editor has finished its startup work and is ready for editing files.\n\n* **version**(version) - Reports the version of the NetBeans interface. **node-vim-netbeans** assumes the version is 2.5. Some functions and events do not work in older versions.\n    * **version** - (`string`)\n\nIn addition to these events, a VimClient also receives events for buffers that it has control of, with the VimBuffer object added as the first argument.\n\nThis allows you to do this:\n```js\nclient.on(\"insert\", function (buffer, text, offset) {...});\nclient.on(\"remove\", function (buffer, text, offset) {...});\n```\n\ninstead of this:\n```js\nclient.on(\"newBuffer\", function (buffer) {\n\tbuffer.on(\"insert\", function (text, offset) {...});\n\tbuffer.on(\"remove\", function (text, offset) {...});\n});\n```\n\nVimBuffer\n---------\n\nA specific buffer in a Vim client that a VimServer controls.\n\n### VimBuffer properties\n\n* **client** (`VimClient`) client connection that has this buffer\n* **id** (`number`) sequential buffer id, starting from 1 for each client\n\n### VimBuffer Functions\n\n* **addAnno**(type, offset):id Place an annotation at a position in the buffer.\n    * **type** - (`AnnotationType`) the annotation type\n    * **offset** - (`number`) byte offset to place the annotation at.\n    * **id** - (`number`) Annotation ID is returned, for use with `removeAnno`\n\n* **defineAnnoType**(type) Define an annotation type in the buffer.

This means it cannot be edited.\n    * **offset** - (`number`) byte position of text in buffer to be guarded\n    * **length** - (`number`) length of text\n\n* **initDone**() Mark the buffer as ready to use. Makes it the current buffer.

This triggers Vim to print a save message.\n\n* **setDot**(offset), **setDot**(lnum, col) Make the buffer the current buffer and set the cursor at the specified position. If the buffer is open in another window, make that window the current window. If there are folds, they are opened to make the cursor line visible.\n    * **offset** - (`number`) position to set cursor at\n    * **lnum** - (`number`) line number to set cursor at\n    * **col** - (`number`) column number to set cursor at\n\n* **setFullName**(pathname) Set the file name of the buffer, and make the buffer the current buffer, but do not read from the file.\n    * **pathname** - (`string`) file name\n\n* **setModified**(modified) Mark the buffer as modified or unmodified.\n    * **modified** - (`boolean`)\n\n* **setModtime**(time) Change what Vim considers as the modification time of the file.\n    * **time** - (`Date`) modification date object\n\n* **setReadOnly**() Mark the buffer as readonly.\n\n* **setTitle**(name) Set the title for the buffer.
